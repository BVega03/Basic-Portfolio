                    <p>Born and raised in southwest Denver. I met my wife while attending Colorado State University (Fort Collins). We have
                        been married 5 years and have been together for over 12 years. We have a dog named Diamond and
                        we currently live in Thornton, CO.</p>

                    <p>I have a BA in Economics from CSU. I currently work for Jefferson County
                        Public Library. I have worked in the Public Procurement sector since graduating from CSU. I am
                        new to
                        coding and the computer programming realm. I may be out of my element right now, but by the end of
                        this bootcamp, my goal will be to have the tools and knowledge to be successful and develop web
                        content to the best of my abilities. I am ready for a career change out of government
                        procurement so, <em><strong>I am all-in on this coding stuff!</strong></em></p>

                    <p>I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling and going to concerts - particularly at Red Rocks &
                        The Gothic. I also like to root for the local Denver's sports teams - Go Broncos, Rox, Nuggets, Avs,
                        Rapids, Outlaws, Mammoth, Rams and yes, even the Buffs (when they aren't playing the Rams)!</p>
